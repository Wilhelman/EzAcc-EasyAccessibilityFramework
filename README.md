# EzAcc: EasyAccessibilityFramework
An accessibility library from scratch in c++ with the ultimate goal of being used by video game developers and thus preventing users with functional diversity from being excluded from the use of the final product.

## Installation instructions (Framework)

Download the zip file and unzip it. Open the folder, obtain the files compiled from the last release of EzAcc. Specifically, the EzAcc.dll, EzAcc.lib files and all the library header files (.h). Once you have all the files in our project, load the library's .lib file from code and locate the file in your project.

_IMPORTANT: do not modify, change or add any folder or file as you might not be able to execute the game engine._

## Installation instructions (Demo Project)

Download the zip file and unzip it. Open the folder, execute the .exe and enjoy! You can find the audio and textures in the _assets_ folder.

_IMPORTANT: do not modify, change or add any folder or file as you might not be able to execute the game engine._

## **Notes on performance**

There are one main known cases where the overall perfomance might decrease significantly:

* **Only the first time** you execute the engine the app will "freeze" as it's importing all the assets and generating its corresponding resources. The time will vary depending in the number and sizes of files that are being imported.
* If the z-buffer visualization is activated.
* When an animated model is loaded on scene **(especially if its playing its animation)** the engine perfomance might drop a lot. That's because the skinning process of deforming the mesh to match the bones positions of the corresponding skeleton needs to do a lot of matrix related operations multiple times per frame. As we don't use shaders in this engine all these operations are sended to the CPU (instead of the GPU) which is not prepared to handle matrix operations as well as the GPU does. 

## Controls in the Demo Project
